# Predict-survival-on-the-Titanic
Hello,

for my second machine learning project, I trained a model that can predict Titanic Survivors. I used Logistic regression method to train this model, and accuracy is so good as you can see in the notebook.

I explained more about the method and training in the notebook.

P.S : for a reason I removed Test section code and instead I Use Validation.
